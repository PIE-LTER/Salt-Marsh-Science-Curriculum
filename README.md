# Salt-Marsh-Science-Curriculum
Curriculum for middle and high school students includes classroom activities, identification sheets and a dichotomous key for identifying salt marsh plants, and data sheets for salt marsh field trips

Is the invasive reed Phragmites spreading in our salt marshes? If yes, how fast is it spreading? What conditions is it growing in? Is it responding to restoration efforts? This curriculum for middle and high school students includes classroom activities, identification sheets and a dichotomous key for identifying salt marsh plants, and data sheets for salt marsh field trips utilizing lessons developed by Kristen Grant and the salt marsh science protocols developed by Dr. Robert Buchsbaum and Dr. David Burdick. Classroom teachers, Carmen Ochoa, Amanda Demetri, worked with Liz Duff to develop the "integrated unit" in 1999. We are pleased to offer you these tried and true methods for studying Phragmites, vegetation, fish and salinity in salt marshes.

The curriculum is broken into smaller units for downloading.
